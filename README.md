# road-app

A **Blockchain Education Mini App** built for **MiniPay** on **Celo**.

Road App is a card-based learning game where players progress through three "phases"
that teach the core security concepts of self-custody on Celo (anti-phishing, seed
backup, smart-contract safety, L2 scaling, fee abstraction). Each phase ends with a
boss battle that, when defeated, mints an on-chain NFT card as proof of learning.

Built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, Hardhat + Viem, Wagmi/RainbowKit, Tailwind and
Turborepo. Designed to satisfy MiniPay's submission requirements (single chain,
stablecoin-only display, no `CELO`/"crypto"/"gas" wording, fee abstraction-ready).

## 📜 Deployed Contracts (Celo Mainnet — chainId `42220`)

All three contracts are live on Celo Mainnet and verified. You can inspect them on
[Celoscan](https://celoscan.io) or [Blockscout](https://celo.blockscout.com).

| Contract | Address | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **RoadAppNFTCards** | [`0x3e3adfd56091511e2e572e40cbb424d3bda54ca6`](https://celoscan.io/address/0x3e3adfd56091511e2e572e40cbb424d3bda54ca6) | ERC-721 collection of 10 educational cards. **Soulbound** (non-transferable). Metadata 100% on-chain via `data:application/json;base64,…` so MiniPay / MetaMask / OpenSea render it without IPFS gateways. Exposes a gas-efficient `getOwnedCards(player)` for mobile RPC. |
| **RoadAppGameState** | [`0xc977c3c1c48c0a24eff78c866f7fed7bfe5a1ff5`](https://celoscan.io/address/0xc977c3c1c48c0a24eff78c866f7fed7bfe5a1ff5) | Player state machine + anti-cheat. Uses **EIP-712** typed signatures with per-player nonces and `deadline` to gate `recordBossDefeat` and `verifySeedPhraseBackup`, blocking replays cross-chain and after restarts. Maintains a paginated on-chain leaderboard so the frontend never has to scan logs on Forno. |
| **RoadAppDeckManager** | [`0x0233dad6871a563e052cc3a3681264f8e0ce37cb`](https://celoscan.io/address/0x0233dad6871a563e052cc3a3681264f8e0ce37cb) | Stores each player's active battle deck (2–10 NFT cards). Validates ownership against `RoadAppNFTCards` on save and provides a cheap `validateDeck(player)` view for the battle screen. Because cards are soulbound, a saved deck can never become silently invalid. |

> **Security posture (audited against Celopedia `security-patterns`):**
> Ownable2Step on every contract · EIP-712 + nonce + deadline · OZ v5 ERC721Enumerable
> for O(balance) reads · soulbound `_update` hook · checks-effects-interactions ·
> custom errors instead of `require(string)` · no `block.timestamp`-based randomness ·
> no function is `payable` (fee abstraction handles gas in USDC/USDT/USDm).

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

To test inside MiniPay on a real phone, expose your local server with ngrok and
paste the HTTPS URL into MiniPay's "Open URL" developer flow.
